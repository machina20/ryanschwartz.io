Test Post

<br />

The content for this post is inside a MDX file and gets interpreted into react by contentlayer at build-time

<br />

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">

I can also include custom react components like this directly inside the MDX

</Callout>

blah blah blah

<br />
Creating a new blog entry just requires dropping a new MDX file into a directory
in the git repo
<br />

````python

#this is some python code using ```python ``` in md

print("Hello, World!")

````
